Polycystic Ovary Syndrome (PCOS) stands as a prevalent endocrine disorder affecting individuals assigned female at birth, characterized by hormonal imbalances and metabolic irregularities. This project delves into the dynamic field of PCOS data analysis using advanced machine learning techniques. PCOS is a multifaceted condition with far-reaching implications on reproductive health, metabolic well-being, and overall quality of life. As a complex disorder, PCOS demands a comprehensive understanding, and innovative machine learning methodologies present an opportunity to unravel intricate patterns, predict trends, and provide valuable insights into its multifactorial nature. The motive behind choosing this project topic stems from my personal experience as an individual grappling with PCOS.

This project caters to a diverse audience, including healthcare professionals, researchers, and policymakers involved in women's health. The application of machine learning in PCOS data analysis not only advances understanding of the disorder but also has the potential to shape future healthcare practices. In the pursuit of unraveling PCOS complexities, this project navigates through existing research, leveraging machine learning methodologies to contribute to the evolving landscape of PCOS analytics and research.
